Tolkien's classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. Instead of starting just where the previous film left off, however, it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback, actor Andy Serkis (who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects) finally gets to appear onscreen, portraying Gollum's former self, Sm\xc3\xa9agol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo (Elijah Wood), who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus, the film returns to the present, following Frodo, Sam (Sean Astin), and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul, watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor, and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol, where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan, having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts, at Helm's Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long, though, since the hobbit Pippin (Billy Boyd) gets into trouble, making it necessary for him and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to hastily depart for Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor. Once there, they find the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead, sending Denethor over the edge of sanity.In another realm, elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens, on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) -- forever, but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan, the men are preparing to ride to Gondor's aide. \xc3\x89owyn (Miranda Otto) desperately wants to join the men in battle, but her uncle, King Th\xc3\xa9oden (Bernard Hill), orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry (Dominic Monaghan) also desires to ride with the men, but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond (Hugo Weaving), who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken (in the ancient battle with Sauron) and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elrond's advice, Aragorn, along with elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), takes a cavernous path through the mountains, where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorn's ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo, Sam, and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. Released in December 2003, The Return of the King topped even its massively successful trilogy predecessors at the box office, and went on to garner a whopping 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture -- winning in all the categories in which it was nominated and tying the record of total awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.

Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. Frodo (Elijah Wood), who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman (Christopher Lee) have robbed King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of his rule. The King's niece \xc3\x89owyn (Miranda Otto) believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and their minions. \xc3\x89owyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen (Liv Tyler). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death. Most of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was shot in tandem with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King during a marathon 18-month shooting schedule, overseen by Peter Jackson.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.

Lots of it.\n\n- Combine the eggs, butter, walnuts, cinnamon, maple syrup, and protein powder in a food processor. For the orange, only put in a 1/4 of the peel and one slice.\nNotes: Put as little or as much protein powder into the drink as you would personally like. If you're making this an energy bar to eat after working out, the more the better. You may also substitute any kind of nut for your bread, as well as honey for the maple syrup.\n- Blend the ingredients on high until liquid\n- Add in 1 cup of flour\n- Blend again until liquid\n- Pour mixture into a mixing bowl\n- Add remaining 1 1/2 cup of flour\n- Add diced bacon (optional)\n- Whisk/blend until batter\n- Pour batter onto a baking pan\n\n- Preheat oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit (204 degrees celsius)\n- Place baking pan in oven for 10-15 minutes\n- Take pan out, flip bread over, place back in oven for 5-10 minutes\n\n- Bacon weave is optional, but highly delicious.

Everything you see is real snow and ice.\n\nStory behind the song:\n\nSo who doesn\'t love a story about an estranged ice princess, a dynamic mountain man/reindeer duo and a snowman obsessed with warm weather? We all loved the movie ""Frozen"" and its single, ""Let It Go."" So much emotion, energy and drama packed into one tune. But we thought we\'d add a little more drama...by melting together ""Let It Go"" and themes from Vivaldi\'s classical piece, ""Winter."" (You can watch an impressive performance of the original here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu6Hr9kd-U0 - see if you can find where we used the main themes from each of the three movements.) Vivaldi\'s almost reckless string motives helped us surround the determined, upbeat melody and chords from ""Let It Go"" with intensity and uncertainty. We wanted the music to alternate between ""freezing"" and ""thawing,"" representing the opposing forces throughout the ""Frozen"" story. \n\nWe were extra ambitious about capturing as much definition of the ice as possible so we decided to give 4K a try (a step up from 1080p HD) using the ""RED"" camera (same camera used in filming ""The Hobbit""). So we called up our buddy Jacob Schwartz who rented us his awesome camera set up! It was challenging for Paul and Shaye to learn a whole new system and camera minutes before the shoot, but after awhile started getting the hang of it...:-) Editing the video on the other hand was a whole new process in processing that 4k footage. It took us 4 times as long to edit the video and fix glitches that kept happening working with such large files! After this experience, we might have to give 4k a try again, but not until we\'ve mastered the art of it all which this video got us on the path at least.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Davis and his way cool crew at the Midway Ice Castles for hosting us. They built this winter palace one icicle at a time. Amazing! They were so nice and they really went the extra mile for us. \nCheck the Ice Castles out here: http://www.icecastles.com/\nIce Castle Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IceCastlesCO\n\nIf you\'ve read this far into the description you\'re awesome.

It was followed by The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003), based on the second and third volumes of The Lord of the Rings.\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.\nReleased on 10 December 2001, the film was highly acclaimed by critics and fans alike, and was a major box office success, earning over $871 million worldwide, and the second highest-grossing film of 2001 in the U.S. and worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) which made it the fifth highest-grossing film ever at the time.\nAs of 2012, it is the thirtieth highest-grossing worldwide film of all time. It won four Academy Awards and five British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film and Best Director BAFTA awards. The Special Extended Edition was released to DVD on 12 November 2002 and to Blu-ray Disc on 28 June 2011. In 2007, The Fellowship of the Ring was voted No. 50 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 greatest American films. The AFI also voted it the second greatest fantasy film of all time during their 10 Top 10 special.\n\nPeter Jackson began working with Christian Rivers to storyboard the series in August 1997, as well as getting Richard Taylor and Weta Workshop to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth.[25] Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, to think of Middle-earth in a historical manner.[26]\nIn November,[26] Alan Lee and John Howe became the film trilogy's primary conceptual designers, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as Rivendell, Isengard, Moria and Lothl\xc3\xb3rien, giving art nouveau and geometry influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively.[26][27] Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath,[26][27] he focused working on armour having studied it all his life.[28] Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations.[26] On 1 April 1999, Ngila Dickson joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, ageing and wearing them out for impression of age.""",b'0',b'UC1R3uROUkpqg3fYuA0C2_RA',b'2d',57,b'67',1,b'41',43,8,7,0,b'24',b'2001 BURGER KING THE LORD OF THE RINGS FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING SET OF 19 KIDS MEAL MOVIE TOYS REVIEW',b'false',0,b'hd',29,b'179754',53,b'486'

Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. Frodo (Elijah Wood), who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman (Christopher Lee) have robbed King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of his rule. The King's niece \xc3\x89owyn (Miranda Otto) believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and their minions. \xc3\x89owyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen (Liv Tyler). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death. Most of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was shot in tandem with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King during a marathon 18-month shooting schedule, overseen by Peter Jackson.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.

Bach\'s Unaccompanied Cello Suite No. 1: Prelude. (Hint: Say Bach\'s title with an English accent and it sounds a lot better). It\'s been featured in a lot of movies (and car commercials)...Steven Sharp Nelson decided that this piece needed some accompaniment (Bach must have been busy and never got around to it? :) Adding some original material and 7 more cello parts stacked on top of each other, Steve has created a cool new sound that embellishes all the features that have made Bach\'s work so popular. The 7 new parts include drawn-out melodies which soar above fast arpeggios, strumming chords from a guitar-like part, shaker sounds (accomplished by rubbing the sides of the cello), tremolo (1:08-1:24), and a cello-banging percussion part (complete with kick drum).\n\n""Bach was an amazing composer -- one of the best that ever lived. He wasn\'t the greatest with titles though (smile)... As a consequence, no one can ever remember his Cello Suite\'s name...so when I\'m asked to perform his piece people always say, \'hey, can you play that ... um ... that cello song?\' And so in Bach\'s honor I name this adaptation of his amazing composition after what it has been naturally called for hundreds of years.

Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. Frodo (Elijah Wood), who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman (Christopher Lee) have robbed King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of his rule. The King's niece \xc3\x89owyn (Miranda Otto) believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and their minions. \xc3\x89owyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen (Liv Tyler). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death. Most of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was shot in tandem with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King during a marathon 18-month shooting schedule, overseen by Peter Jackson.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.

Years after we last saw them, Dante is still toiling behind the counter at a New Jersey convenience store and Randall is still annoying customers at the video shop next door -- or at least they are until a fire burns down the strip mall, forcing Dante and Randall to look for work. Times are tough, and the guys find themselves embracing the ultimate indignity as they take jobs at Mooby\'s, a fast-food outlet where the burgers are advertised as ""udderly delicious."" While Randall\'s snarky attitude toward the public remains unchanged, Dante is trying to make the best of the situation as he plans to marry his fiance, Emma (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith), and move to Florida. However, Dante\'s plans are complicated when he falls for Becky (Rosario Dawson), a funny and tart-tongued woman who happens to be his boss at Mooby\'s. Lurking about in the background, as always, are Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith), who for good or ill have changed even less with the passage of time than Dante and Randall. Clerks II also features Wanda Sykes, Ethan Suplee, and Trevor Fehrman, with cameo appearances from Kevin Smith regulars Ben Affleck and Jason Lee.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 MGM (2006)\nCast: Jeff Anderson, Trevor Fehrman, Kevin Weisman\nDirector: Kevin Smith\nProducers: Carla Gardini, Laura Greenlee, Scott Mosier, Bob Weinstein, Harvey Weinstein\nScreenwriter: Kevin Smith\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.

This led us to the creation of a cool hip hop/classical mash-up, but again we could not get permission.  Instead of scrapping the great ideas, we used them to create an original tune.  You will hear influences and inspiration from other artists. Try and guess them. \n\nOn the recording, Steven Sharp Nelson laid down over 100 tracks including cello textures never known possible.  Every single sound on the video was made using only the instruments shown: piano, cello, mouth percussion and kick drum. We utilized some cool effects on lots of stuff...for example the U2-style delay on Steve\'s pizzicato at the beginning.\n\nThe extra string on the electric cellos (the black cello has an extra high string and the white cello has an extra low string) allowed us to cover the full range of the orchestra.  The deep bass drum sound is a bump on the body of the cello with a little help from some effects.  The shaker sound was created by Steve rubbing rosin on his bow.  The record scratch is Steve scratching a quarter on the strings...you get the idea.\n\nSpecial SPECIAL thanks to Paul Anderson and Tel Stewart ""The Piano Guys"" who put as much of themselves into the video as we did and without whom the video would never have happened.

Follow the hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, on their journey to destroy The One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.  Through the eyes of Samwise the brave, The Hillywood Show\xc2\xae brings you a magical tribute to Peter Jackson\'s memorable trilogy in an unforgettable, precious way. Once it\'s taken a hold of you, you\'ll never want to let it go.  This is One Parody to rule them all.\n\nFUN FACT: In 2003, Hilly Hindi won a trip to New Zealand where she interviewed the cast and crew on the red carpet at the Return Of The King premiere, including Peter Jackson, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom + more.  That win inspired her to continue filmmaking and is just one of the reasons on how The Hillywood Show\xc2\xae was born in 2006.\n\nUPDATE:  The incredible and talented SEAN ASTIN (Samwise the Brave, himself) has seen our video, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: LET IT GO PARODY and loved it!  He tweeted saying he ""Loves it!""  and he reached out to Hilly saying, ""Your talent and creativity know no bounds.  I expect greatness from you in the years to come!!!""  Check out his official tweet here: https://twitter.com/SeanAstin/status/545534500726267906  Thanks so much again, Sean! \n\nWatch in 720, 1080 or 4kHD for full Middle-Earth Experience!  \nEnjoy and God bless.\n_____________________\n\nWATCH BONUS FEATURES FROM THE LORD OF THE RINGS: LET IT GO PARODY \xe2\x9c\xae\n\nThe Behind the Scenes: http://youtu.be/J_sv4ithqlI\nSam Gamgee\'s Video Diary:  http://youtu.be/K2yp51b0_pE\n_____________________\n\nFOLLOW THE HILLYWOOD SHOW \xe2\x9c\xae\n\nSubscribe: http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=JckSparrow\nWebsite: http://www.TheHillywoodShow.com\nMerchandise: http://www.ShopHillywood.com\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/HillywoodShow\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/TheHillywoodShow\nTumblr: http://www.TheHillywoodShow.Tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/TheHillywoodShow\nE-mail For Business/Press Inquiries: TheHillywoodShow@aol.com \n_____________________\n\nFOLLOW HILLY \xe2\x9c\xae\n\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/HillyHindi\nFacebook: http://www.Facebook.com/HillyHindiOfficial\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/HillyHindi\nTumblr: http://www.HillyHindi.Tumblr.com\nVine: @HillyHindi\n_____________________\n\nFOLLOW HANNAH \xe2\x9c\xae\n\nTwitter: http://www.Twitter.com/HannahHindi\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hannah-Hindi-The-Official-Page/102206209819456?fref=ts\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/HannahHindiOfficial\nTumblr: http://www.HannahHindi.Tumblr.com\n_____________________\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Executive Produced by Nerdist.com: \nhttp://www.nerdist.com/vepisode/nerdist-presents-the-lord-of-the-rings-and-frozen-mash-up-parody-by-the-hillywood-show/\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Composed/Arrangement:\nhttp://www.johnhogemusic.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/John-Hoge/158556244209142\nhttps://soundcloud.com/john-hoge\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Violinist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sedibluebird\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vocals:\nhttp://www.andrewsbates.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/hullbkh\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Title animation:\nhttp://robertholtby.com/\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Artwork:\nhttp://bohemianweasel.com/\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In Dreams Cover by:\nhttp://www.bevani.com/\n\nShare this on Twitter: http://tinyurl.com/o386to8\nShare this on Facebook: http://tinyurl.com/n4x2wx9\n#LOTRParody'",b'0',b'UCuYRxRuTAtmeE2AiR5WWWHQ',b'2d',9,b'4169',1,b'865',6,7,55,19,b'24',b'The Lord Of The Rings: Let it Go Parody by The Hillywood Show\xc2\xae',b'false',0,b'hd',17,b'1896026',19,b'48863'

I remember many years ago watching the movies, also pure genius, and wanting to play the music on my keyboard, I used to learn the music by ear at the time of release of the films. I also have all three soundtracks on CD and they are treasures to say the least. There are so many beautiful and stirring themes that Howard Shore wrote, I think he was put on 'middle' earth just so he could write music for these movies.\n\nYou could say a great deal of work went into this arrangement, it is my most ambitious and biggest performance to date. Below I list all the pieces I include in my arrangement/performance in order:\n\nFoundations Of Stone\nGollum's Song\nMany Meetings\nAniron\nThe Council Of Elrond\nThe Riders Of Rohan\nEvenstar\nMinas Tirith/The White Tree\nThe Grey Havens\n\nThese happen to be the most emotionally connected tracks to me and so I thought to make it the best arrangement I would choose the music I remember and cherished most of all from the trilogy. \n\nIn terms of the structure of the arrangement, I opted to start with the theme that opens 'The Two Towers' movie purely because that has the strongest connection with me in terms of how I remember any of the movies starting, it is a wonderful deep and sweeping panoramic piece that accompanies the exact same setting/opening scene in the movie - panning over the icy mountains. This of course leads to the dramatic and utterly insane 'falling' battle between Gandalf and the Balrog Demon.\n\nAfter this I decided to play a segment from 'Gollum's Song', originally this was not in the arrangement at first, I later added it in because I thought it was not complete without this haunting piece of music, and Gollum is central to the movies of course. After a little hint of 'Many Meetings' I play Aniron (actually composed by Enya) which is a beautiful melodic fantasy piece I had to include. This then cuts to 'The Council Of Elrond' and perhaps the central theme to the movie trilogy, a wonderful epic and adventurous motif used to great effect throughout the films, 'The Ring Goes South' particularly uses this main theme to great effect as the companions walk over the wilderness on their journey. \n\nWith this theme I lead directly onto 'Riders Of Rohan' which I remember accompanies the viewers fist glimpse of Rohan in 'The Two Towers' Movie. This is a very strong and emotional theme played originally on the charismatic Hardinger - Norweigan Fiddle. Next I play 'Evenstar' which again is a beautiful melodic piece of music referencing to Arwen giving Aragorn said jewel. I blend next into a recapitulation of the main 'Concerning Hobbits' theme (also used many other times throughout the movies and in other tracks on the albums) I played earlier in the piece, this time in D major, not C major as I originally played it.\n\nThis gives me the platform to move onto the amazing Return Of The King main theme, used throughout the final movie and soundtrack. 'The White Tree' is actually one of my favourite pieces of soundtrack music, and the soundtrack version actually differs slightly to the one Shore used in the film, a stunning scene where the torches are lit across the landscape to call the armies of Rohan into helping fight the battle. I used to play this piece of music alarmingly loud many years ago in my room, its like one long crescendo of sound with strings sweeping up and down and everywhere, I could never learn this particular piece by ear to be honest, there is far too much going on to be able to reduce it down to a piano arrangement in my opinion.\n\nMinas Tirith is also a wonderful piece of music and the scene where Gandolf climbed the stone city is probably the stand out scene for me out of all movies.\n\nI finish on an excerpt from 'The Grey Havens', this short theme is used several other times in the 'Return Of The King' to beautiful effect. I wanted to end on this theme as it has a certain air of hope and beauty about it, like a calm and serene conclusion to a great war. A very emotional short theme which I feel a very strong connection to.\n\nHope you enjoy and I would like to dedicate this video to all my followers and avid listeners, I have had quite a few requests to do LOTR, so this is for you.\n\nThanks for listening\n\nMark ;)""",b'0',b'UCCWTtFf8wpLlCZHenYUGZKw',b'2d',10,b'1246',1,b'92',34,9,32,23,b'10',b'The Lord Of The Rings - Piano Suite',b'false',0,b'hd',27,b'967766',32,b'11331'

Although it manifests in various sorts of orchestrations, it's most distinctive when played on the Hardanger Fiddle. The first part of this theme is heard most often but it's occasionally followed up by a second part. On this site, I refer to this simply as the Rohan Theme.\n\n\xc3\x89OWYN AND TH\xc3\x89ODEN, a theme from Rohan, is one of \xc3\x89owyn's three themes. This triple time one, representing her relationship with Th\xc3\xa9oden, keeps the same harmonics as \xc3\x89owyn, Shieldmaiden of the Rohirrim, but is more developed. DA describes it as having a 'delayed upwards arc' (CR-TTT Liner Notes 18). The cadence makes me think of walking with a step-together-pause walk like you see brides or graduates having. But at least one instance of the \xc3\x89owyn Shieldmaiden theme seems to have this cadence (the stew scene) so perhaps I'm missing a more important difference.\n\n\xc3\x89OWYN, SHIELDMAIDEN OF THE ROHIRRIM, a theme from Rohan, is one of \xc3\x89owyn's three themes.

The audience stood and applauded for several minutes, stopping intermittently only to wipe their eyes. It is a memory we will never forget.

Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. Frodo (Elijah Wood), who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum (Andy Serkis), a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard (voice of John Rhys-Davies), a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman (Christopher Lee) have robbed King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of his rule. The King's niece \xc3\x89owyn (Miranda Otto) believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and their minions. \xc3\x89owyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen (Liv Tyler). Gandalf (Ian McKellen) offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death. Most of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was shot in tandem with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King during a marathon 18-month shooting schedule, overseen by Peter Jackson.\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.

I know, I was surprised too\nBut probably not as surprised as Luke.\n\nThe troll moves in for the final kill\nBut his efforts are thwarted by Frodo\'s mithril\nThey all stand in awe when they probably should kneel\nIn the presence of The Lady of the Wood, Galadriel.\n\nHe\'s bald, he meditates, and dresses like a Hindu\nHe wield a purple light saber, he\'s Mace Windu\nHe eats Cocoa Puffs, and that is why he\'s coocoo\nSo don\'t cross hairs with that dirty Count Dooku.\n\nAfter getting stabbed, Frodo starts to turn pale\nLuckily for him Arwen gets him to Rivendell\nSam and Frodo\'s friendship it is so presh\n""What is that?

Simple & perfect.\n\nPippin's Song, composed by Billy Boyd himself, was also a track that you guys have requested several times, and one that gave me goosebumps while watching the film.

It\'s a blend of Warcraft III and Battle Realms (LE\'s previous game). Although the game itself is rather average (Battle Realms was much, much better imo), the music\'s not. The score was composed by Chance Thomas (who\'s latterly linked to LOTR universe) and Lennie Moore (best known for his work on ""Outcast"" soundtrack).\r\n\r\nIf you want, check out these links - you\'ll find more info about the composers and some downloadable tracks:\r\nLennie Moore Homepage - http://www.lenniemoore.com/\r\nChance Thomas Homepage - http://www.hugesound.com/\r\n\r\nThis compilation consists of some promo tracks found on the net and game-ripped in-game music.

They are marked with a star):\r\n 0:00 : Lord of the Rings Logo Theme (* The Pelennor)\r\n 0:42 : Dwarven Song of Triumph (* Baruk Khazad, Lament for Oakenshield - slower version)\r\n 2:03 : Mirkwood Good Battle\r\n 4:05 : Iron Hills Good Battle\r\n 6:15 : Ettenmoors Good Battle\r\n 8:24 : The Valor Of Men Suite (* Lonelands)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n--- Druga cz\xc4\x99\xc5\x9b\xc4\x87: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2dra5klfFk ---\r\n\r\n""W\xc5\x82adca Pier\xc5\x9bcieni: Wojna o Pier\xc5\x9bcie\xc5\x84"" to RTS stworzony przez Liquid Entertainment.

Tolkien\'s best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval ""Middle-earth"" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the ""One Ring,"" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band\'s odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson\'s native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).\n\nCREDITS:\nTM & \xc2\xa9 Warner Bros.
